# Murmur

Murmur 2.0 is a new iteration of Aakash’s hugely moving show Murmur. The work has been extended as a full length production. A major audience hit, Murmur is an honest view of the tribulations of Aakash’s dyslexia. There are also enhanced educational packages for Murmur 2.0 which includes post-show stage demonstrations around the technology and dance.

Invited by Aakash Odedra, Imanol Gomez designed and developed the new software running the show, optimising and creating new stunning visuals and effects.
